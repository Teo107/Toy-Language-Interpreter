# Toy Language Interpreter 🧸

The **Toy Language Interpreter** is a console-based application that interprets and executes a simplified, custom programming language.  
It was developed as part of the **Advanced Programming Methods** university course to explore core concepts of interpreters and runtime environments.

It is implemented following the **Model–View–Controller (MVC)** architecture, ensuring clear separation between the program’s logic, data, and interface.
